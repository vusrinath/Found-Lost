The Concept
In the show, the characters are constantly searching for answers and supplies in mysterious hatches. Found! ensures you aren't "lost" in your own home by giving every box a digital identity. 
App Description
The Dharma of Organization: Stop living in the "Twilight Zone" of mystery bins. Create a name for your storage box (e.g., "The Swan Station" or "Winter Gear") and instantly generate a unique, printable QR code.
Not Penny's Boat (But Definitely Your Box): Tag every item inside the box so you never have to play detective again. Whether it’s a "Polar Bear" plushie or "Hatch" tools, the app keeps a meticulous inventory.
Search the Island: Use the powerful search feature to find items by name or box. No more opening ten different containers to find your holiday lights—just type it in, and the app will tell you exactly which "Station" it’s in.
Scan to Reveal: Use your iPhone's camera to scan the QR code on any box. The app will immediately display a list of everything inside, fulfilling the prophecy: "Everything happens for a reason... and now you know where it's stored."
